# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Learn-StrictYAML
# About:
# I decided to make StrictYAML the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-StrictYAML) as StrictYAML is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the StrictYAML programming language. This language is a variant of YAML, and there aren't many significant syntax changes that can be made for this file. It only makes sense to StrictYAML the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
# This is an instance in which I am using StrictYAML as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language, and I extended this to other languages, this time with StrictYAML. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)
gitattributes: ".gitattributes"
